# profile_app

The purpose of this project is to provide a UI and dataflow example for a basic user profile within a larger application.

Due to time constraints, editing of the name, phone, email, and bio fields have been implemented. The editor for the profile image is not currently functional.

## Getting Started

The following instructions are intended **for macOS users**:

This project is written in Dart using the Flutter framework. If you do not have a Flutter development environment installed on your computer, please do so according to the Flutter documentation, found here: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos

During setup, be sure to follow the steps regarding iOS setup, as the framework will run the application using an iOS simulator.

Once Flutter is installed, you can clone this repository and run the application using the `flutter run` command within the repository. You may be prompted to configure a target for the application, in which case you will need to select the iOS simulator.

**Note: It is recommended the simulator for an iPhone with a notched screen, such as iPhone 12, be used during testing.**
